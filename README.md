# CS50-FinalProject
My CS50 final project

This is my CS50 Final project. Its a spin on the classic game of Tetris, but with an updated soundtrack.
The soundtrack reflects the amount of time you have been playing for. As the game slowly gets harder, the music progressively gets mor and more powerful. It really adds another dimension to the game. 

## Controls

Control the movement of the characters with the arrow keys, and their rotation with a and d.
